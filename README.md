### Hi, I'm Miranda

I have dabbled in coding several times over the past few years (mostly some Python, C# for Unity, and a little bit of HTML/CSS), so I'm no stranger to the joy of building cool stuff!

Currently exploring all things software development, dipping my toes in a few languages.

Most interested in backend development.
