### Hi, I'm Miranda

I am experienced at QA and project planning in a technical work environment, but I'm happy to learn any new tool or skill best suited for the job. I love problem solving. Every "problem" is just a challenge with many solutions!

Interested in software development, backend technologies, testing/QA, CLI tools and automation.
